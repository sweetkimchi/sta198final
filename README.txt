This replication folder contains the following files:
README.txt
Shift Project survey questionnaire - abridged.pdf
Seattle_SSO.dta
Seattle_SSO.do
Seattle_SSO_codebook.log

Seattle_SSO.dta and Seattle_SSO.do are the only files required for the replication. Seattle_SSO.do runs on Seattle_SSO.dta to create all figures and data used in the paper. 

Please note the only change to the code required is in line 16 to set the file path to where the replication files were downloaded.

This code was run on Stata 16: https://www.stata.com/stata16/

The data is a portion of the data collected by The Shift Project. See the website for more information: https://shift.hks.harvard.edu/
